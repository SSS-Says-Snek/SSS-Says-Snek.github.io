    <h1>Hey, I'm SSS-Says-Snek!</h1>

    <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
    <p>
      I've programméd in Python for about three and a half years now, almost 4, 
      and made <strong>a few</strong> projects (Nah, there's like 500 python files in my folder)<br/>
      Started <i>programming</i> in late 2015/early 2016, 
      but started programming <i>in a text-based language (Python OFC)</i> in around late 2017/early 2018.
