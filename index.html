    <h2>A bit about myself</h2>
    <p>
      I've been programming in Python for about four years now, 
      and made <strong>a lot</strong> of projects<br/>
      I started <i>programming</i> in late 2015/early 2016, 
      but started programming <i>in a text-based language (Python OFC)</i> at around late 2017/early 2018.
