    <h1>Log Browser</h1>
    <p>
      Basically, Starting on Jun 9th, 2021, I recorded logs of my everyday life, for my decendants to see what kind of life I lived in. And who knows, maybe it might even be something to help me with dementia if I ever get it :shrug:</br>
      So, we got all these logs on disk, how do we read them easily? Well, that's where log browser comes to play. It allows ez reading of the logs
