    <h1>Proj√©cts</h1>
    <p>
      I have done a lot of projects, ranging from discord bots to... more discord bots.<br/>For real though, 
      I also made some GUIs, games, and scripts to stop my brother from playing Roblox. Currently interested 
      in PyGame the most though, so that's that...
