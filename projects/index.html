    <h1>Proj√©cts</h1>
    <p>
      I have done a lot of projects, ranging from networking projects to... more networking projects.<br/>For real though, 
      I also made some GUIs, games, and scripts to stop my brother from playing Roblox. Currently interested 
      in networking and sockets the most though, so that's that...

    <h2>Best ones</h2>
    
    <h3><a href="https://hisock.readthedocs.io"</a>Hisock (MAIN)</a></h3>

    <h2>Garbage dump</h2>
    
    <h3><a href="https://sss-says-snek.github.io/projects/community_bot">Community Bot</a></h3>
    <p>
      A "small" bot I made for my Discord server of IRL friends. One of my biggest projects, with ~3k lines of code! It was made when I was just 
      starting to experiment with python for real, so this also is one of the WORST projects I've made, codebase-wise.
