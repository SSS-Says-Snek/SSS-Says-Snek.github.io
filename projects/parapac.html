    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
      The year is 1980. You have time-travelled over 4 decades back, into the era of arcade games. You visit your favorite arcade games, like Pong and Space Invaders, but when you play Pac-Man... well, it is a tiny bit different.</br>
      Turns out, the arcade machine that contains this version of Pac-Man (dubbed "ParaPac") is a failed time machine, made by the government.</br> 
      A few years later, the goverment covered up project ParaPac, and replaced it with the Pac-Man we know today.</br>
      However, you think that if you finish the boss level, the arcade machine will time travel you back. It will be very difficult though, as NO ONE has finished a game of ParaPac.</br>
      However, you are filled with determination, wanting to go back to your era.
