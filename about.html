    <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
    <p>
      It was late 2015 (or was it early 2016? IDK I have terrible memory :kekw:), when I was in 3rd grade, 
      our GRC teacher gave us an activity that used <strong>Scratch</strong>. I was immediately drawn into Scratch, 
      and made some stuff that I cringe at today.</br>I used Scratch for some more years, then in late 2017/early 2018 
      (<i>Yes I forgot if it was 2017/2018</i>), my mom bought me a <strong>Python</strong> book. At first, I tried to read it, 
      but my 0 IQ didn't understand anything, so it just copied-pasted the examples. As a result, I didn't get too far with python, 
      and took a "short" 8 month break from programming in general.</br>
      Then, in April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I now had loads of time on my hands, so I picked up Python again.
      This time, I was able to understand a lot of it, and it is now my favorite language.</br>
      While making discord bots, I encountered <strong>SQL</strong> (Structured Query Language), which is very useful for 
      databases and all that stuff. So, I started to learn MySQL, and became decent at it.
      In 2021, I also picked up on <strong>HTML</strong>, as a few years back I tried to make a website, but my 
      HTML skills were virtually nonexistant.
      In Mid June of 2021, I decided to start learning <strong>C++</strong>, because C++ can be very useful for a lot of things.</br>
      Currently, I am using Python and learning C++ (Python's superior OFC)
