    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I'm currently 14, and go by the name of <i>SSS_Says_Snek</i>/<i>SSS-Says-Snek</i> on a lot of websites.<br/>
      I love Milky Ways and eating in general. 
      Dad jokes are also very welcome in my mind. You can see me making tons of dad jokes every day.<br/>
      I like playing games, currently playing Minecraft and BTD6, and loving Guardian Tales.<br/>
      I constantly make <a href="https://sss-says-snek.github.io/secret">Rick Rolls</a>, so be careful
      when I post a link!

    <h2>My Programming Journey</h2>
    <h3>First Experience</h3>
    <p>
      Around late 2015 or early 2016, when I was in 3rd grade, 
      our GRC teacher gave us an activity that used <strong>Scratch</strong>. I was immediately drawn into Scratch, 
      and made some stuff that I now cringe at today.</br></br>I used Scratch for some more years, then in late 2017/early 2018, 
      my mom bought me a <strong>Python</strong> book. At first, I tried to read it, 
      but my 0 IQ brain didn't understand anything, so it just copied-pasted the examples. As a result, I didn't get too far with python, 
      and took a "short" 8 month break from programming in general.</br></br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Getting Back to Programming</h3>
    <p>
      Then, in April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I had loads of time on my hands, so I picked up Python again.
      This time, I was able to understand a lot of it, and it is still my favorite language.</br>
      While making discord bots, I encountered <strong>SQL</strong>, which is very useful for 
      databases and all that stuff. So, I started to learn MySQL, and became decent at it.
      In 2021, I also picked up on <strong>HTML</strong>, as a few years back I tried to make a website, but back then, my 
      HTML skills were virtually nonexistant.</br></br>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Expanding My Horizons</h3>
      In Mid June of 2021, I decided to start learning <strong>C++</strong>, because C++ can be very useful for a lot of things. 
      However, this brief interest in C++ would die within a week.</br>
      In Late August of 2021, I started to gain interest in networking and cryptography; this continues to be my main passionate interest, 
      after learning some more advanced Python</br>
      In early January of 2022, as a New Year's resolution, I decided to learn C, then also try learning C++ afterwards.</br>
      In mid February of 2022, I decided to start learning C++, and am still learning it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Current Programming Endeavors</h3>
    <p>
      Right now, I'm mainly programming in Python and SQL, while also learning C and C++.
    </p>

    <h2>More about my skills</h2>
    <p>
      I like math, and NGL, I have to admit that I'm <strong>kind</strong> of good at it.</br>
      Of course, I'm a pretty strong programmer.</br>
      I'm also decent at science, and have an interest in it.</br>
      I play trombone and piano, for 2.5 and five years respectively.</br>
      Currently interested in Networking, Cryptography, and C++</br>
      I also have the unique ability to make any sports team lose once I start playing on their team.</br>
    </p>
    <h2>Enough of the boring stuff, what about me as a person?</h2>
    <p>
      Surprisingly, in real life, I'm an introvert. Yes, online, I talk a lot, but less so in real life.</br>
      I'm pretty sensitive to certain stuff, and overall, I don't get angry a lot (sometimes tho, my brother just annoys me so much >:(  )</br>
      As you have guessed from the top sentence, ye, I'm not that popular in real life. Sure, I do have friends, I'm just not that outgoing, I guess.</br>
